## Project Summary
 
Selecting a course(s) is often a challenging task for every student due to a lack of proper data and reviews. Students must navigate multiple course websites, talk with other students, and search for reviews on review pages or any social media platform such as Reddit. Our intention is to streamline all this process into a single one-stop destination where a student can get almost any information they need about a particular course to help them make a choice about whether that course is right for them or not. Also, instructors can get a better understanding and insights about the course structure and assignments from multiple data points and metrics generated from student activity.

This tool collects, assembles, and visualizes multiple data points at assignment level granularity for different courses offered at UIUC every term. This tool displays data at different levels of a course - from assignments, and exams to the entire aggregated course level. Each student can also review the course at an assignment level and provide his/her difficulty level. This data will be useful for both students and Instructors.
With the help of this application, instructors can gain a detailed understanding of student performance and use the information to improve the learning environment for upcoming semesters. They can organize the course appropriately based on their understanding of how the students do on each assignment.
