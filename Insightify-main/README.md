## Project Summary:

Selecting courses is often challenging for students due to the lack of comprehensive data and reviews. Our project aims to streamline this process by creating a one-stop destination where students can access all relevant information about courses offered at UIUC. This tool collects, assembles, and visualizes data points at assignment-level granularity for different courses every term, providing insights on course structure, assignments, and student performance.

Students can review courses and provide feedback on assignment difficulty, which can guide future students in making informed course choices. Instructors can use this detailed data to better understand student performance and make informed adjustments to the course structure. This tool benefits both students and instructors by improving course selection and enhancing the learning environment through data-driven insights.
